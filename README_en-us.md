This is not the official program source code of Phigros. Here we only provide some historical versions of the Android armv8a apk package download from Xiamen Pigeon Games. Please do not use it for any other commercial purposes. <br>All materials are collected from the Internet. If they infringe your rights, please post an issue in this section and I will delete them immediately after seeing them.
<br>
Warning: Some versions may be restricted by real-name verification and cannot be entered. We are working hard to solve this problem.
<br>
## How do I download them?
[**‚ÜóÔ∏èGo to Github‚Äôs release area**](https://github.com/SteveZMTstudios/Phigros-history/releases)

<br>
## Some instructions
Tip: All packages with clone characters are modified package name versions and can coexist with your existing Phigros. The ones containing crack are extracted directly from the old installed equipment. <br>
In other words, the crack suffix is the same as the application published on TapTap. It can be updated from this repository or from TapTap. It will not be affected in any way, but it cannot coexist. <br>
The clone suffix is a coexistence version, which can coexist with the crack version or the latest version of TapTap, but the archive cannot coexist, which is a headache.
