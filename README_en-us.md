## Announcement
Cause I do not have enough time to maintain it, future update uploads may be delayed. If you want to help this project, or if you already have a new cloud disk version, please send the sharing link to the issue partition. Thank you very much for your help!

### For Global user
This project may use some website that from China Mainland. If you have problems to visit them directly, you can check such as [apkmirror.com](https://apkmirror.com) or [apkcombo.com](https://apkconbo.com).

This is not the official program source code of Phigros. Here we only provide some historical versions of the Android armv8a apk package download from Nanjing Pigeon Games Network limited company. Please do not use it for any other commercial purposes. <br>All materials are collected from the Internet. If they infringe your rights, please post an issue in this section and I will delete them immediately after seeing them.
<br>
Warning: Some versions may be restricted by real-name verification and cannot be entered. Try to enable the airplane mode?
<br>

## Some instructions
Tip: All packages with clone characters are modified package name versions and can coexist with your existing Phigros. The ones containing crack are extracted directly from the old installed equipment. <br>
In other words, the crack suffix is the same as the application published on TapTap. It can be updated from this repository or from TapTap. It will not be affected in any way, but it cannot coexist. <br>
The clone suffix is a coexistence version, which can coexist with the crack version or the latest version of TapTap, but the archive cannot coexist, which is a headache.
